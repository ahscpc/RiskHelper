# RiskHelper

A very tiny application designed to help roll dice for the board game Risk.

Usage:

The "Attacking Units", and "Defending Units" and fields where the user would input the number of units they have.
Once the units have been inputed, press "Roll Once" to roll the virtual dice. The roll will be displayed in the "Attacker Roll", and "Defender Roll" fields. Units are automatically removed after the roll.
